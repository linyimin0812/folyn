# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

# Engineering Principles

- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.

- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.

- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.

- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.

- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.

- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.

- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

- **Do NOT run whole-project compiles/builds** (`cargo check`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm tauri build`, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks. These load many files into the toolchain and cause computer lag on this machine. The user will edit files themselves; your job is to ensure the changes are syntactically correct (visually verify types/imports/signatures). Run targeted single-file checks (`tsc --noEmit` on one file, `cargo check -p <crate>` on one crate) only when syntax correctness genuinely cannot be verified by reading.
